== Introduction

Hello! if you're reading this then you're either taking the zig embedded workshop at SYCL 2023, or you're just curious. Either way, welcome!

NOTE: you will need to solder wires to the speaker. You can use a different speaker if you like, but it must be 3W, 4 ohm.

== Prerequisites

* https://git-scm.com/downloads[Git]
* https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/gnu-rm[Arm GNU Toolchain (for GDB)]
** NOTE: for the windows installer, select the "add to path" option
* Some sort of programming environment. If you are unsure, refer to <<Setting up VS Code for Zig and Embedded Development>>

=== Installing Zig

Your laptop will fit under one of these platform strings:

* x86_64-linux
* x86_64-macos
* x86_64-windows
* aarch64-linux
* aarch64-macos

Open a command prompt/terminal run the command `./tools/zigup/<platform>/zigup master`, on windows it will be `zigup.exe`. This will install the zig compiler on your machine.

If this does not work for you for some reason, you can download zig from https://ziglang.org/download/[here]. We are using the master build for this workshop.

=== OpenOCD

At the time of writing, I've not been able to get the current release of OpenOCD (0.12.0) working correctly on MacOS, this was sourced using `brew`. Instead I have found success with https://github.com/raspberrypi/openocd[Raspberry Pi's fork of OpenOCD].

If you run `windows` or `macos` I've committed binaries to this repository since they're easy to package. If you run `linux` though you'll have to build it on your own inside of "tools/openocd/bring-your-own". This folder and it's correct contents are created when the following commands are run from the root of this repository:

[source]
----
cd tools/openocd
git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/openocd bring-your-own
cd bring-your-own
./bootstrap
./configure --enable-picoprobe --prefix $PWD/install
make -j4 install
----

==== Permissions on Linux
By default, serial devices on Linux (The picobrobe being one of them) are not usable by non-root users. To enable access, you must add a udev rule in "/etc/udev/rules.d" to tell Linux that you want the permissions on the device to be writable by all users. This can be done by running the following command:

[source]
----
echo 'ATTRS{product}=="*CMSIS-DAP*", MODE="660", TAG+="uaccess"' | sudo tee -a /etc/udev/rules.d/60-openocd-picoprobe.rules
----

The pico probe should work after re-plugging it into your computer.

== Setting up VS Code for Zig and Embedded Development

Extensions to Install:

* https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ziglang.vscode-zig[Zig]
** When you open up a zig file, this extension will ask if you'd like to enable ZLS, I suggest you do.
* https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-serial-monitor[Serial Monitor]

== Cloning

[source]
----
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ZigEmbeddedGroup/sycl-workshop-2023.git
cd sycl-workshop-2023

== Building and running a demo using UF2

1. Compile the demos by running `zig build` in your project root.
2. To activate the uf2 bootloader, power must be applied to the pico while the `BOOTSEL` button is held. This is best done by connecting a button from `RUN` to ground, pressing both buttons, and releasing the `RUN` button first, then `BOOTSEL`. The other option is to plug/unplug the USB cable which is awkward and gets tiresome.
3. Copy the uf2 file into the mounted drive. Execution should take place immediately

== Building and running a demo using the Pico Probe

1. Run `zig build openocd` in a terminal, it will invoke the correct flags for you. You need to restart this command if you unplug the debugger, otherwise just keep it running in the background.
2. In a separate terminal, compile the demos with `zig build`.
3. Run:
  a. `arm-none-eabi-gdb <path to the executable>`
  b. `> load`
  c. `> run` and confirm

CTRL-C will interrupt operation if you need to set breakpoints. There is a `.gdbinit` file in this project that tells GDB to initially connect to `localhost:3333`
